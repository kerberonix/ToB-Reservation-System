# ToB-Reservation-System

A simple software application built with ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6.

The system is a mock up booking software system for a company which offers coach services to tourist attractions all over Britain.

The system is a pure server-side application and uses the MVC approach, with ASP.NET razor to render the views.

Try out the application:

utilising a variety of nuget packages (DataTables, typeahead, bootbox)
